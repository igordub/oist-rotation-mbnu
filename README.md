# Bacteria in Microchannels

__One Paragraph+__  The goal of this rotation project is to expand experimental work on growing bacteria in microchannels done by the Micro/Bio/Nanofluidics Unit which builds upon the previous rotation at the Biological Complexity Unit at OIST.

## Data

Describe the dataset in more detail here if necessary

__Data Contact__

List a data contact that can be contacted for inqueries regarding archiving and/or removal of data. Two methods of contact should be left, including one that is outside / external to the current institution.

* **Daniel E. Cook <danielecook@gmail.com>** - Contact for inqueries regarding data located in `primary/data/folder`.
* __Expiration Date__ -  YYYYMMDD - Data can be (deleted | archived) <-- choose one

Most scripts / analysis can be left as they often do not take up substantial amounts of space, so it is important to describe in detail how data should be handled.

## Getting Started

What are the primary analysis scripts/starting points? How would the analysis be rerun?

```
Give an example
```

### Requirements

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development/analysis env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using. It is also worth listing what the requirements are.

## Publications

List references with links to publications this analysis was used for.
